# IELTS Institute — Homepage (React + Tailwind)

This is a responsive, modern landing page for a fictional IELTS training institute. The project emphasizes UI quality, accessibility, and modular React components.

## What you'll find
- Modern, minimal responsive design
- Components split into `Navbar`, `Hero`, `Features`, `Testimonials`, and `Footer`
- Placeholder images and content that you can customize


## Setup
1. Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed.
2. Clone the project and install dependencies:


```bash
npm install
```


3. Start the dev server:


```bash
npm run dev
```


4. Build for production:


```bash
npm run build
```


## Design choices
- **Tailwind CSS** for fast, responsive styling and consistent spacing
- **Color palette**: deep-blue brand color (`brand-500`) and accent yellow for CTAs
- **Layout**: hero with image + CTA, feature cards in grid, testimonials in cards — focuses on hierarchy and readability
